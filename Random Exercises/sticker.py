# Example solution for an interview question
# Facebook logo stickers cost $2 each from the company store. I have an idea.
# I want to cut up the stickers, and use the letters to make other words/phrases.
# A Facebook logo sticker contains only the word 'facebook', in all lower-case letters.
#
# Write a function that, given a string consisting of a word or words made up
# of letters from the word 'facebook', outputs an integer with the number of
# stickers I will need to buy.
#
# get_num_stickers('coffee kebab') -> 3
# get_num_stickers('book') -> 1
# get_num_stickers('ffacebook') -> 2
#
# You can assume the input you are passed is valid, that is, does not contain
# any non-'facebook' letters, and the only potential non-letter characters
# in the string are spaces.

    sticker ={}
